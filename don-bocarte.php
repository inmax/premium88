                            DON BOCARTE ANCHOVIES
                        </h4>
                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            Don Bocarte produces anchovies only from the Bay of Biscay in Spanish extra virgin olive oil with low-salt level and extremely clean of spines. These anchovies are produced under a unique production method in order to attain one of the world’s great culinary products.
                        </p>
                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            The period for catching top-quality anchovies on the Bay of Biscay is April, May and June, which is when Don Bocarte purchases the highly prized fish.
                        </p>
                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            Don Bocarte carries out this process as quickly as possible, so that the anchovy takes on the right amount of salt, which is essential for its preservation.
                        </p>
                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            Having salted the anchovy, it is gutted and the head is removed for subsequent packing.
                        </p>
                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            The fishes are placed in 30-litre containers in the form of fans with a layer of salt on each level.
                        </p>
                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            The purpose of the presses is to remove fat from the anchovy so that the fish can start maturing.
                        </p>
                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            In our maturing cellars the fish will be salted for a minimum of 8 months, during this time the temperature and humidity are controlled in order to achieve the characteristic aromas of Don Bocarte anchovies.
                        </p>
                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            Once the salted fish has obtained its perfect bouquet and aromas, the anchovy is then manually cleaned. It is the taken to the filleting room where our staff finish off the process by leaving the anchovies completely clean, bringing out their best appearance and texture.

                            Don Bocarte produces anchovies only from the Bay of Biscay in Spanish extra virgin olive oil with low-salt level and extremely clean of spines. These anchovies are produced under a unique production method in order to attain one of the world’s great culinary products.
                        </p>
                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            The period for catching top-quality anchovies on the Bay of Biscay is April, May and June, which is when Don Bocarte purchases the highly prized fish.
                        </p>
                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            Don Bocarte carries out this process as quickly as possible, so that the anchovy takes on the right amount of salt, which is essential for its preservation.
                        </p>
                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            Having salted the anchovy, it is gutted and the head is removed for subsequent packing.
                        </p>
                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            The fishes are placed in 30-litre containers in the form of fans with a layer of salt on each level.
                        </p>
                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            The purpose of the presses is to remove fat from the anchovy so that the fish can start maturing.
                        </p>
                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            In our maturing cellars the fish will be salted for a minimum of 8 months, during this time the temperature and humidity are controlled in order to achieve the characteristic aromas of Don Bocarte anchovies.
                        </p>
                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            Once the salted fish has obtained its perfect bouquet and aromas, the anchovy is then manually cleaned. It is the taken to the filleting room where our staff finish off the process by leaving the anchovies completely clean, bringing out their best appearance and texture.

                    DON BOCARTE BONITO (tuna fish)
                </h4>
                <p class="P15 PBot">
                    As with our anchovies, we use only bonito (tuna) from the Bay of Biscay. It is prepared using only raw materials (not frozen), medium-to-large “bonitos” ensure its tenderness and delicacy. Just the right mount of salt and a meticulous cooking process are some of the characteristics that lead to a distinctive, juicy, unique and delicate product preserved in Spanish extra virgin olive oil.
                </p>
                <p class="P15 PBot">
                    There is another secret that makes this astounding product even more exclusive: how it is cut. Instead of using traditional lengthwise cut, our masters use a unique technique that has been developed during the last years to obtain bonito pieces where our extra virgin olive oil infiltrates more easily, thus making it a perfect blend of olive oil and bonito in the palate.
                </p>
                <p class="P15 PBot">
                    Bonito is ideal for combining with salads, vegetables or even fruits and it can also be enjoyed by simply putting it over a slice of bread previously seasoned with extra virgin olive oil.
