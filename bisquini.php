                    Butter Cookies are an old tradition from Denmark. The first cookies that we know of were made around year 1100. From late 1800’s, most Danish homes were equipped with stoves so everyone could make their own cookies easier. The first bakeries were started late 1800’s, later approximately 10 bakeries with more sophisticated facilities were established.
