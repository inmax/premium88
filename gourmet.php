                            Butter Cookies are an old tradition from Denmark. The first cookies that we know of were made around year 1100. From late 1800’s, most Danish homes were equipped with stoves so everyone could make their own cookies easier. The first bakeries were started late 1800’s, later approximately 10 bakeries with more sophisticated facilities were established.

                                Saffron from La Mancha with Protected Designation of Origin is characterized by its high colouring (it is noteworthy that our Quality Technical Specification requires a minimum dye to 200 units), has a strong and exotic aroma and a slightly bitter taste. These features make it a great flavour able to convey deep aromas, with an irreplaceable spice in many recipes from the Middle Ages to today.
