                    The Golden Boot Fine Wine is obtained from the total fermentation of the “palomino” grape variety. The development and protection of natural yeasts prevents oxidation of the wine throughout their upbringing and it gives this unique wine its very special characteristics. The biological aging continues for a minimum period of three years and is done in American casks using the traditional “solera” system of hatcheries.

                            Its colour is bright yellow to pale golden straw. It has sharp, delicate aromas, with hints of almond and notes of fresh bread dough and herbs of the field. On the palate it is very dry, delicate and light. In the aftertaste it brings almond memories, leaving a fresh feeling in the palate.

                            Golden Boot Fine Wine should be served very cold, between 7º C and 9º C. It is ideal for the aperitif (olives, nuts and ham). Also recommended with seafood, anchovies and raw sashimi. Because of its low content of acetic acid, it exceptionally combines with prominent acidity dishes (salads with vinaigrette, marinades, etc.)

                        <p class="P15 PBot">
                            It is also an ideal wine for foie-gras and blue cheese.
