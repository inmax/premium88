                <p class="P30 PBot ">
                    There are a variety of antioxidants in olive oil including Vitamin A and E but the most potent compound is hydroxytyrosol.

                <p class="P30 PBot">
                    As explained earlier, olive oil is abundant in antioxidants. These antioxidants work really well as moisturizers. One of the main reasons why olive oil works really well as a moisturizer is the hydrophilic properties of these antioxidants which allow it to form a protective barrier trapping moisture on your skin. Lots of skin products used various synthetic chemical that do moisturizer but they clog your pores and are carcinogenic in some cases. For this reason, olive oil can be applied on your face. In addition to that, its deep penetrating properties not only moisturize your skin but also help brighten your skin.

                    Exfoliating skin helps remove clogged pores and dead skin cells. But why use olive oil? One of the main reasons is because it does not clog pores. The other reason is because it smoothens your skin texture and softens your skin due to its intrinsic antioxidant properties.
