                    Wine is one of the mainstays of the Mediterranean Culture and Rioja wines are one of the best known around the world thanks to its unique and prestigious “Qualified Denomination of Origin”.

                <p class="P30 PBot">
                   The history of Rioja wines comes from the Middle Age due to the fact that winemaking in the Mediterranean area had strong ties with the monastic life, since it was mainly the monks who made it widely known.

                            This wine is the utmost expression of the area´s young wines, with marked notes of liquorice, blackberries and raspberries; a very fresh, cherry-purple wine with an intense rim. In the mouth it is very pleasant, with tangy notes that accentuate its personality. Maceration after fermentation is shorter for this wine, in order to take advantage of the primary aromas from the grape, which is fruitier and less ripe, thereby enhancing the traits of the Tempranillo grapes. Ideal serving temperature is 14-15ºC and the wine has a life of 3 years, during which it will continue to improve. It does not require decanting or airing before serving.

                <p class="P15 PBot">
                    Our Crianza stands out for its pleasant fruit combined with light oxidation of the barrel, which contributes with agreeable notes of vainilla and tobacco, while underscoring very satisfying tannins that contribute structure. Its long finish invites one to continue enjoying it. The cherry-red colour and slightly orangey rim point to its stay in barrels, although not enough to denote oxidation, making it a very well-balanced wine.
                </p>
                <p class="P15 PBot">
                    The wine is racked four times over the two-year period it is aged in casks. It is then allowed to age in the bottle for at least one year and a half before being put on the market. Its round mouthfeel makes it the perfect product to drink now, although it will keep for up to ten years, with marked improvement.
                </p>
                <p class="P15 PBot">
                    Appropriate serving temperature is 17-18ºC. If left to breathe for about half and hour before serving, it will offer a full range of enjoyable aromas. Monitoring its evolution from the moment it is uncorked is a very interesting experience.

                <p class="P15 PBot">
                    A Gran Reserva wine is a Great Work. We cannot use just any wine to make it, so we have to start with a base wine that meets special conditions in terms of structure, colour, tannins and aromas. This wine is therefore made with grapes from our oldest vines, from which we obtain very small, highly-concentrated berries, with very low yields and extraordinary quality.
                </p>
                <p class="P15 PBot">
                    After a stay in American oak barrels for 48 months with eight rackings, it is aged for a further 36 months in the bottle before being put on the market. This achieves a perfect balance between the oxidation of the wood and the reduction of the bottle, making it an exclusive wine that offers a wide gamut of pleasant aromas, including chocolate, cocoa, coffee, very ripe fruit, stewed fruit and prunes.
                </p>
                <p class="P15 PBot">
                    Its ruby-red colour with an orange rim evinces the wine´s age. It is persistent in the mouth, with notes of toffee. Optimal serving temperature is 18-19ºC and it should always be aired for at least one hour before pouring, as it requires contact with oxygen in order to attain its aromatic fullness. The wine is put on the market at the right moment for drinking but, if kept in a dark, cool, dry place it will improve over a period of at least ten years.
